15 Puzzle Game is a simple logic game which I created with JavaScript, HTML and CSS preprocessor - Sass.

During second semester of my Computer Science studies I had to make a **15 Puzzle Game** in **C** language, which the results you can check right [here](https://github.com/Lyczeq/15-Puzzle-Game-in-C). It was such an exciting experience, because I had to manage the memory. I learned a lot about it and about working with 2D Arrays.

This time I've wanted to learn the basics of above technologies, in which I want to expand:books:

### Game's Rules
These are pretty simple. The player has to order the squares with particular numbers **from 1 to 15 leaving last square empty**.
If he wins, he will see something special, which I can't tell:sunglasses:
